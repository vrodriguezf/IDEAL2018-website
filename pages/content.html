						Many problems in optimization and computational intelligence are very challenging to solve, and some of these problems can be NP-hard, which means that there are often no efficient algorithms to tackle such hard problems. In many cases, nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithms can be a good alternative and such algorithms include genetic algorithms (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), firefly algorithm (FA) and many others. Over the last two decades, nature-inspired algorithms have become increasingly popular in solving large-scale, nonlinear, global optimization with many real-world applications. They also become an important of part of optimization and computational intelligence. This tutorial will provide a critical analysis of recent algorithms using mathematical theories such as Markov chains, dynamic systems, random walks and self-organization systems. This will provide some insight into these algorithms and their proper use in applications.

						The possibilities and advantages of applying Machine Learning to solve the most diverse problems are beyond question. It has been proved how this wide set of techniques can help to address varied issues related to computer vision, natural language processing, fraud detection, robotics or bioinformatics, among many others. In this tutorial we aim to present the possibilities of this field when dealing with a complex, current and critical problem: the detection of malware in Android devices. As we will show, Machine Learning techniques such as classification and clustering algorithms, deep learning or evolutionary computation are currently being employed to detect those malware samples whose behavior exhibits malicious patterns. Furthermore, we will explain the different tools designed for performing Android malware analysis and reverse engineering processes. Finally, we will describe in first place our framework <strong>AndroPyTool</strong>, aimed at extracting a wide set of features from Android applications with the goal of deeply charactering their behavior and in second place the <strong>OmniDroid</strong> dataset, a comprehensive dataset of features from Android benign and malicious applications.
					</p>

						Radicalization has been a relevant topic for Europe in recent years, especially with the growth of terrorist groups like Al Qaeda or Daesh. The threat this groups represent has led to a increment of the efforts to understand how radicalization works, how to measure it and when a person becomes in risk of being radicalized. With this aim, Europe has founded several projects to fight this topic from several perspectives, including the recent application of Big Data to the detection and measurement of the risk of radicalization. 
					</p>
					<p>
						This workshop raises two different objectives. First, it will serve as a final presentation of the RiskTrack Project, presenting the tool developed by a European consortium to detect and measure radicalization in Online Social Networks. Secondly, topics related to the study of terrorism and counter-terrorism will be discussed, focusing specially on how the radicalization can be detected, assessed and countered. Finally, a discussion about the future perspectives on radicalization tracking will be held by the workshops attendees. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Potential topics of interest include but are not limited to:
						<ul>
							<li>Radicalization measurement.</li>
							<li>Big Data techniques and their contribution to counter-terrorism.</li>
							<li>New tendencies in the study of terrorism.</li>
							<li>Linguistic assessment of radicalized profiles.</li>

					<h5>Description</h5>
					<p>
						The objective of the workshop is to discuss novel intelligent data analysis methods suitable for the analysis and interpretation of industrial event logs. We aim to include and possibly combine two distinct perspectives. The first uses methods from data mining and computational intelligence. The second uses background domain knowledge for conceptual analysis. We would like to focus on (but not limit to) the applications of the mentioned methods according to those two perspectives to Industry 4.0. In this setting, the source of the event logs would be industrial machinery, but also possibly personnel or activity monitoring devices.
					</p>
					<p>
						Topics of interest of the workshop include:
						<ul>
							<li>activity recognition in the industrial setting</li>
							<li>anomaly detection on event log data</li>
							<li>conceptual modeling of industrial processes</li>
							<li>conformance checking of industrial process models</li>
							<li>event logs abstraction methods</li>
							<li>intelligent analysis of multi-sensor data</li>
							<li>industrial case studies with real-life complex event logs</li>
							<li>industrial process modeling</li>
							<li>knowledge graphs on event log data</li>
							<li>network analysis on event log data</li>
							<li>ontologies for industrial domains</li>

						The workshop aims to bring together researchers in the fields of human-computer
						interaction and data science, acting as a seed for further exchange of ideas and cross-
						community fertilization.
					</p>
					<p>
						Human-computer interaction research is essentially human centered and can benefit
						from a broader and more thorough understanding of the state of the art of the field of data
						science when tackling challenges such as adequately scaffolding people interacting with and
						through computers. On the other hand, data science is essentially theory and technology
						centered and could benefit from the human-centeredness conveyed by the practices and values
						of the human-computer interaction community. Greater symbiosis between these two
						communities has the potential of improving the symbiosis between people and computing
						technology, facilitating the necessary balance between the convenience, pressure and overload
						that concomitantly characterize our contemporary relation with technology.
					</p>
					<p>
						In practical terms, data science can help HCI when the amount of data from user
						experience or interface evaluation becomes too large for traditional data analysis to handle; this
						could happen, for example, when collecting longitudinal data from large set of user with wide
						range of demographic characteristics, or when measuring single user very precisely with
						multiple sensors such as psychophysiology, eye-tracking and video capture. Conversely, data-
						science could benefit from HCI when designing visualizations and tools for exploring these kinds
						of complex data sets to make it as easy as possible to derive meaningful insights and patterns.
					</p>
					<p>
						The contributions to the workshop should reflect several aspects of Intelligent
						Computing. From Data Science perspective the focus may be on proper machine learning and
						data mining as well as, (big) data management methods and technologies in support of data
						analytics, procedures upon which HCI related research issues find their solutions. From the
						Human-Computer Interaction point of view, the focus could be on how to use current data
						analysis processes to enable adaptation, recommendation and user interaction scaffolding.
					</p>
					<p>
						The workshop will facilitate the discussion of many theoretical and practical aspects of
						the interplay between human-computer interaction and data analysis and modeling. The main
						target will be the establishment of a joint understanding of the relevant challenges and resulting
						research agenda.
					</p>
					<p>
						Topics of interests (included but not limited to):
						<ul>
							<li>Interaction, management and visualization of big data</li>
							<li>Novel interaction techniques for data science</li>
							<li>Design, development and evaluation of interactive data science</li>
							<li>Interfaces for Distributed Data and Knowledge Processing</li>
							<li>Design, development and evaluation of intelligent interfaces</li>
							<li>User modeling and and Business Intelligence Systems user-adapted interaction</li>

					<h5>Scope</h5>
					<p>
						In the last decade, global energy demand has increased to non-previously seen levels, mainly due to the increase in population, fierce urbanization in developed countries and aggressive industrial development all around the world. Conventional fossil-based energy sources have limited reservoirs and a deep environmental impact (contributing to global warming), and therefore they cannot satisfy this global demand for energy in a sustainable way. These issues related to fossil-based sources have led to a very important development of Renewable Energy (RE) sources in the last years, mainly in renewable technologies such as wind, solar, hydro or marine energies, among others. In this regard, Machine Learning (ML) techniques have been demonstrated to be excellent tools to cope with difficult problems arisen from new RE sources. There are many RE applications which can be tackled by ML techniques, such as prediction problems (e.g. solar radiation or significant wave height estimation), optimization algorithms (wind farm or RE devices’ design), new control techniques or fault diagnosis in RE systems, all of them with the common objective of improving significantly RE systems.
					</p>
					<p>
						This special session aims to cover a wide range of works and recent advances on the application of ML techniques to RE problems. We hope that this session can provide a common forum for researchers and practitioners to exchange their ideas and report their latest finding in the area.
					</p>
					<h5>Topics</h5>
					<p>
						In particular we encourage submissions addressing the following issues: 
						<ul>

						Evolutionary Computation has a great popularity in the current scientific community, being the focus scope
						of many research contributions in the literature year by year. The rationale behind the acquired momentum
						by this broad family of methods lies on their outstanding performance evinced in hundreds of research fields
						and problem instances. In this regard many different inspirational sources can be found for these solvers,
						such as the behavioral patterns of ants or swarms of particles, as well as the mechanisms behind genetic
						inheritance and brain connections. Furthermore, this type of techniques is being applied to a wide range of
						problems and areas of knowledge, such as transportation, medicine or industry. The proposed special session
						is focused on the development of Evolutionary Computing methods and their application to data mining,
						data science and big data. More specifically, we will analyze the latest theoretical advances on the use of this
						kind of techniques in any of the aspects and processes related with data science, as well as the latest real-
						world applications regarding this topic.

					<h5>Scope and topics</h5>
					<p>
						Data selection focuses on reducing the training time and, at the same time,
						taking advantage to do better predictions. Too much information is not handy at all
						since uninformative samples or features may be learnt and consequently the ability to
						generalize could be hindered. Addressing any problem may mean not having prior
						knowledge and even to become able, through data selection and even transformation
						measure, to learn the important data for the forthcoming prediction on unseen data.
						Depending on the followed methodology to conduct the process model for data mining,
						the data selection may be named with different names although the core is the same.
						Tools based on graphical user interfaces are of particular interest in the sense that
						may make easier the procedure to refine the raw data and eventually to get the ready
						data to face the mining phase. Data pre-processing deals with many tasks such as
						data cleansing, attribute selection, instance selection, noise reduction and detecting
						wrong or distorted labels. Visual data analytics is on the rise especially in multi-
						dimensional business applications. We encourage to submit very recent applications
						and if possible unprecedented. Additionally, new theoretical or empirical approaches
						are welcome.
