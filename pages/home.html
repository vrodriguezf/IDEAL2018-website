Its core themes include: the Big Data challenges, Machine Learning, Data Mining, Information Retrieval and Management, Bio- and Neuro-Informatics, Bio-Inspired Models (including Neural Networks, Evolutionary Computation and Swarm Intelligence), Agents and Hybrid Intelligent Systems, and Real-world Applications of Intelligent Techniques. Other related and emerging themes and topics are also welcome.
</p>
<p>
    The conference provides a unique opportunity and stimulating forum for presenting and discussing the latest theoretical advances and real-world applications in Computational Intelligence and Intelligent Data Analysis. Authors and researchers are warmly invited submit their latest findings and research work to the conference.

<h2 class="mt-4">Call for Workshops and Special Sessions</h2>
<h3 class="mt-4"> Special Sessions </h3>
<p>
    In addition to the regular sessions, there will be special sessions devoted to emerging topics and areas with growing attention. Researchers and prospective organizers are invited to submit a one-page proposal for a special session to the conference chair David Camacho [<a style="color:blue" href="Mailto:david.camacho@uam.es">david.camacho@uam.es</a>]. Each proposal should include the following information:
    <ul>
        <li>The title of the special session.</li>
        <li>The organizers with their affiliations.</li>
        <li>A description of why the topic is of special interest and how it fits to the scope of IDEAL. Each special session preferably consists of four or more presentations. Special sessions receiving less than 4 papers will be merged into a suitable regular session.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h3 class="mt-4">Workshops</h3>
<p>
    Workshops focus on new and emerging topics. In contrast to special sessions, workshops should include an introductory talk or tutorial on the topic and will have final discussions at the end of the workshop. Apart from the introductory talk in the discussion, Workshops should preferably include six or more additional presentations. Researchers or prospective organisers are invited to submit a one-page proposals for workshops to the conference chair David Camacho [
    <a style="color:blue" href="Mailto:david.camacho@uam.es">david.camacho@uam.es</a>]. In addition to the information required for special sessions, workshop proposal should also include the following:
    <ul>
        <li>The name(s) of the presenter(s) of the introductory talk.</li>
        <li>A theme for the discussion.</li>
    </ul>

<h2 class="mt-4">Paper Format and Review Process</h2>
<p>
    The paper format of Special Sessions and Workshops is the same as for the main track of the conference and so is their submission and review process (while each Special Session or Workshop can appoint its own reviewers if necessary, in additional to the main PC).
