    The <b> <i>International Conference on Intelligent Data Engineering and Automated Learning (IDEAL)</i> </b>
    is an annual international conference dedicated to emerging and challenging topics in intelligent data analysis, data mining and their associated learning systems and paradigms. Its core themes include: the Big Data challenges, Machine Learning, Data Mining, Information Retrieval and Management, Bio- and Neuro-Informatics, Bio-Inspired Models (including Neural Networks, Evolutionary Computation and Swarm Intelligence), Agents and Hybrid Intelligent Systems, and Real-world Applications of Intelligent Techniques. Other related and emerging themes and topics are also welcome.
  </p>
  <p>
    The conference provides a unique opportunity and stimulating forum for presenting and discussing the latest theoretical advances and real-world applications in Computational Intelligence and Intelligent Data Analysis. Authors and researchers are warmly invited 
    submit their latest findings and research work to the conference.
  </p>
  <p>
    Potential session/workshop organizers are invited to enlist potential papers in a cohesive topic for their special session(s)/workshops. Proposals and enquiries can be sent to [<a style="color:blue" href="Mailto:ideal2018@uam.es">ideal2018@uam.es</a>].
  </p>
  <p>
     The proceedings will be published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence.

  <h2 class="mt-4">Instructions for authors</h2>
  <p>
    Authors are invited to submit their manuscripts (in pdf format) written in English by the deadline via the conference online submission system (available in due time). All submissions will be refereed by experts in the field based on
    originality, significance, quality and clarity. All contributions must be original, should not have been published elsewhere and must not be submitted elsewhere during the review period. The nominal length of each paper is 8 pages and any paper that exceeds this limit will incur extra page charges on the registration form. In any cases, a paper must not exceed 12 LNCS pages. Papers must comply with the format of Springer LNCS/LNAI Proceedings. (see <a style="color:blue" href="www.springer.com/lncs">www.springer.com/lncs </a>)

  <h2 class="mt-4">Call for Workshops, Special Sessions and Tutorials</h2>
  <h3 class="mt-4"> Special Sessions </h3>
  <p>
    In addition to the regular sessions, there will be special sessions devoted to emerging topics and areas with growing attention. Researchers and prospective organizers are invited to submit a one-page proposal for a special session to the conference address [<a style="color:blue" href="Mailto:ideal2018@uam.es">ideal2018@uam.es</a>]. Each proposal should include the following information:
    <ul>
      <li>The title of the special session.</li>
      <li>The organizers with their affiliations.</li>
      <li>A description of why the topic is of special interest and how it fits to the scope of IDEAL. Each special session preferably consists of four or more presentations. Special sessions receiving less than 4 papers will be merged into a suitable regular session.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <h3 class="mt-4">Workshops</h3>
  <p>
    Workshops focus on new and emerging topics. In contrast to special sessions, workshops should include an introductory talk or tutorial on the topic and will have final discussions at the end of the workshop. Apart from the introductory
    talk in the discussion, Workshops should preferably include six or more additional presentations. Researchers or prospective organisers are invited to submit a one-page proposals for workshops to the conference address [
    <a style="color:blue" href="Mailto:ideal2018@uam.es">ideal2018@uam.es</a>]. In addition to the information required for special sessions, workshop proposal should also include the following:
    <ul>
      <li>The name(s) of the presenter(s) of the introductory talk.</li>
      <li>A theme for the discussion.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <h3 class="mt-4">Tutorials</h3>
  <p>
    Tutorials at IDEAL will be presented by domain experts to cover current topics relevant to researchers and practitioners of the field of intelligent data analysis, data mining and their associated learning systems and paradigms. Each tutorial will be 1 hour long. We encourage the inclusion of interactive activities and demos. Tutorial proposals should be submitted by e-mail to the IDEAL 2018 conference address [<a style="color:blue" href="Mailto:ideal2018@uam.es">ideal2018@uam.es</a>]]. Each tutorial proposal should include:
    <ul>
      <li>A half-page extended abstract that includes: the title of the tutorial, the name and affiliation of the instructor(s), and a description of the tutorial scope and content.
      </li>
      <li>
        Short biography of the instructor(s) (about half page).
      </li>
      <li>
        [Optional] A description of any interactive activity or demo planned within the tutorial presentation.
      </li>
    </ul>

  <h2 class="mt-4">Paper Format and Review Process</h2>
  <p>
    The paper format of Special Sessions and Workshops is the same as for the main track of the conference and so is their submission and review process (while each Special Session or Workshop can appoint its own reviewers if necessary, in additional to the main PC). All accepted papers will be included in the conference proceedings. The proceedings will be published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence.
